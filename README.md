# React Hooks TDD satisfying quest 

The [React Hooks TDD satisfying quest](https://bookout.co.il/2020/07/14/react-hooks-tdd-satisfying-quest/) is part of the [Not So Fancy App Challenge](https://bookout.co.il/category/notfancyappchallenge/)

>  TDD (Test Driven Development) was something I wanted to try for a long time. As a solo-programmer dinosaur, Iâ€™m was used to storming at every task, looking at the visual side as a reference to the progress. Thioretecly, TDD made sense, but thinking about the self-discipline required to stop the eager rush, before each step, and write something that seems not related to the main goal, looked frustrating. Well, it appears I was wrong.
